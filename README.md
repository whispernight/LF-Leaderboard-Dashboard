This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## INTRO
In an attempt to learn and improve my react skills, I created the LF leaderboard dashboard.
It reflects the interest we have in fitness at Life Fitness and the competitiviness on our workouts.


### First Setup.

Run 'npm i'

### Test, build and deploy:

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs locally the web app.

## `npm run build`

Will create a build under the /build folder which will be then ready to deploy, in this case, to firebase.


### DEMO
Production deployment / DEMO can be seen [here](https://lfgymdashboard.web.app/)
